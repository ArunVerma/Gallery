# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

I have used the below Ruby and Rails version:

* Ruby version :  2.4.1p111 (2017-03-22 revision 58053) [x86_64-darwin16]

* Rails version : 5.1.4

Please perform below steps to run the app:-
1. Clone or download the application
2. Make sure above ruby and rails versions are installed
3. cd to application folder (Gallery)
4. bundle
5. rails db:create && db:migrate (migrate can be skipped as no db table is used.)
6. rails s (and now you see the home page where log files (in .text format) can be uploaded and output would be displayed.)

Use command 'rails test' from console to run the test
